This branch of the ArduPlane source code (titled NASA_ULI_v_4_0_0) is used to generate custom code for the ArduPlane 4.0.0 release. 

It is part of the research being done in the University of Washington Aeronautics and Astronautics Department via the 
NASA and Boeing student-led University Learning Initiative for Supersonic Commercial Transport Capstone Project. 

This project is overseen by A&A professor Eli Livne and Boeing Retired Research Fellow Chester (Chet) Nelson, 
as well as Professors Dana Dabiri and Reza Soltani. 

The focus of this project is two-fold:
1) Analysis is done on the configurational aerodynamics of proposed Supersonic Commercial Transport Aircraft 
to define an adequate and representative Wind Tunnel Model.

2) A representative geometry R-UAV is designed with custom Avionics and Flight Control Implementation  

Technical Documentation of the program can be requested to the author at the user's behest.
